Cargo gestalts

Homogeneous for all angles (no load straps or other asymmetrical details)
	- coils
	- square tarps

Heterogeneous for some or all angles, non stacking.  In length units of 1/8 - 4/8, then combined in multiples for other lengths
	Vehicle length, stackable (probably need stakes on vehicle)
		- pipes/tubes
		- dimensional lumber
		- tree length logs
	Unitised (only one graphic per unit), length of graphics can vary to length of vehicle
		- loads covered by tarpaulins
		- vehicles / machinery
	Sub units (two graphics per unit: 50% loaded, 100% loaded)
		- crates
		- cut logs
		- livestock
		- barrels
		- sugar cane
		- bales
	Special case
		- ISO containers (lengths are not in 1/8 units)

Homogeneous cargos
- component png for each cargo
	- one angle
	- standard crop

Vehicle length, stackable cargos:
- components png containing sprites for one stackable: 
	- for each length 1/8 - 8/8
	- for 4 angles
	- possibly coloured bg for auto-crop, or use crops
