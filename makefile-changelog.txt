- Feature: Add 'addcheck' which checks for dependencies not added to the mercurial repo
- Feature: Add target 'docs'
- Feature: Make the version string a dependency for the nfo and txt files. This is important when a change is commited or the repo is updated to the previously commited tag, thus the version incorporated in files has to change, too.

- Change: Disable warnings directly in the nfo files and don't chop away comments in the nfo code on pre-processing
- Change: Deprecate target 'bananas' as changelog.txt is supported now. Use 'tar' instead.
