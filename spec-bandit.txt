* Basic premise: truck styles  *

At TTD scale, there is not much to distinguish in details of cabs etc.  Also, truck appearance has not changed greatly since about 1950.  

So with some detail variation, basically the following:
- US conventional (bonneted truck)
- US cabover truck
- European conventional (bonneted truck)
- European cabover truck 

'Rest of world' trucks are basically older European and US models for this set.


* Basic premise: manufacturers & models *

No real world models.

Two main truck companies competing with each other.  For each model (and model generation), the benefits of one manufacturer will be offset elsewhere by the other.  So faster truck might be lower capacity, or less reliable.  Cheaper truck might be shorter life etc.

At least one other company will simply deliver heavy, powerful, durable trucks.  These will be *expensive*, and probably not the fastest.

Models will evolve stats similar to NARS 2 and HEQS, however there will be definite distinction between types to make upgrading older models possible with auto-replace.  This is one reason for having multiple manufacturers releasing models.

Possible names:
- Gmund
- Trollhattan / troll
- Dalahast
- Tuve

* Basic premise: truck types *

Trucks are offered in a range of classes, this dictates number of axles, capacity, power etc.

Trucks are also either:
- tractor (fifth-wheel articulated), typically no cargo capacity, although IRL some are dromedary/camel with cargo bodies + fifth wheel.
- rigid, cargo body, plus optional trailers via drawbar 

IRL trucks may have combinations of fifth wheel and drawbar trailers, forming B-trains, doubles, LHVs etc.

IRL fifth-wheel tractors can switch to any trailer at no cost.
IRL rigid trucks can be fitted with new body types at some cost.

The challenge is how to make this elegant when building + running vehicles.  There are a number of challenges:
- rv-wagons doesn't exist, and there is currently no interest in it.
	/ start rv-wagons?	
- using cargo subtype refits to determine number of trailers (by hiding some trailers) is clunky and can lead to hundreds of options in the refit menu.
	/ improve refit by splitting cargo subtype from cargo (would improve other areas)?
- giving rigid vehicles n hidden trailers prevents using them with drive-into road stops, this is limiting. 
	/ duplicate all rigid models to 'trailer' 'no trailer' versions (buy menu spam)?
 	/ just say "BANDIT doesn't work with drive-into road stops"?


* Classes *
- light truck: 8-14 tons capacity  (US class 6, 2 axles, truck)
- medium truck: 14-22 tons capacity  (US class 7, 2 or 3 axles, truck or tractor)
- heavy truck: 22 tons capacity upwards (US class 8, 3 or 4 axles, truck or tractor)

- standard (refit anything, middle for HP, TE, costs, run costs; day cabs etc)
- express (sacrifice payload for speed, limited refits (limit bulk & liquid cargos), high HP, low TE; expensive, higher run cost, aero sleepers etc).   Express trailers could use bigger vans.
- vocational (limited refits (limit express cargos), expensive, long lasting, high HP, high TE; dump trucks, log trucks etc - day cabs, high clearance chassis).

There are no class 6 vocational trucks.  Only class 7 or 8.
Express and standard trucks are available in all classes.
An express truck will carry less payload than an equivalent-class standard truck for the same all up weight.  It will be faster and more powerful, and cost more to buy and run.

- guarantee some trucks with no trailers, e.g. at least one in each class with no drag / pup

"2 axle tractor unit 7000 kg and a tri axle curtain sider 5000 kg,tri axle reefer 7000 kg,tri axle skeletal about 5000kg 3 axle tractor about 8000 kg.Articulated means it bends at the 5th wheel.Fully laden max is 44000 kg but if its on a 5 axle rig you got to pay more road tax than a 6 axle outfit"

- a 5 axle truck might cost less to buy but cost more to run for same capacity (tax, component wear) <- might be too detailed
- reefers should have a run cost

Company 1.  
Standard, express + vocational trucks

Company 2.
Standard and express trucks

Company 3.
Vocational trucks, and class 8 standard heavy tractor only


*Early trucks 1898-1920*
3-7t
20-30hp
5-15mph

*1920s-1940s*
Rapid growth in capacity and speed â€¦ 150HP, 45mph by 1937
Few cabovers before 1950
Lots of trucks introduced, some rubbish

*1950s-1970s*
Length and capacity limits reached temporarily
Relatively high speeds, but limited power
US trucks mostly cabovers

*1980s-2000s*
US cabovers mostly replaced by conventionals
Bigger, higher capacity trucks
Horsepower increases
Maximum speeds reached in this generation
Aerodynamics 

*2010s-2050s*
Alternative fuels
Longer, heavier vehicles

*Implementation*
Lots of trailers needed.
Fooling with cb36 to set props based on ID of lead vehicle is a headache.
Easier to hard code on new ID + use a lot of templates. 
Trailers need to be matched to specific capacities (including fraction of actual capacity for 1st trailer in a consist, with some capacity on lead vehicle to ensure TE).
Drawbar / dolly trailers behave differently to fifth wheel trailers.
Trailers need to be matched to cargo refits of the tractor.

The position of rear axles appears to be arbitrary - could be randomised graphics?
Use of tridem versus tandem on non-train trailers appears to be arbitrary - could be randomised (or vary by cargo)?
Auto-refit should be allowed only to same trailer type. 
US trucks limited around 36t gross
Rest of world - trucks gross 40t-50t
Ignore that - set limits for gameplay








-----------------------
A K123 is a K100 series with a vendor supplied, and sometimes KW air ride, tandem drive rear axle setep. 21 was a single axle, 22 single with a dead axle, 23 as stated, 24 had 44K or larger axles, normally on hendrickson or KW air, and 25 was reserved for torsion bar, and at least a few were KW air. My 108" cab has KW air suspension, and was called a K123, as is the 1973 86" cab my dad bought new with Reyco 102 spring. Same goes for the W900 series, and backs up to the 500 and 800 series basically, a few changes were made over the time. John, I may be on the track of determining what letters in the model number of a 523 designated cab type. So far I have found KCC's with Bullnose cabs, and all but one conventional I have found is listed as a CC. I have an original chassis record from 1960 and is for a K-825, with the full model number listed later as a KCC-825, and as a COE. For now I will assume the K in front designated a cab over style, but we all know what assuming can do. Still have yet to figure out what is differnet from a 525 to an 825.
